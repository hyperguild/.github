# HYPERSPACING GUILD OF DEVELOPERS
> A.k.a the HyperGuild

## Overview

The **Hyperspacing Guild of Developers**, or **HyperGuild**, is a new kind of organization native of the 21st century **hyperworld**.

## The Game

Reality is played solo or in teams of arbitrary size. You can belong to several organizations, called *family*, *friends*, *companies*, *countries*, etc. Here, we belong to a particular kind of org called *guilds* (more on that later).

The point of teams is to earn XP faster, to complete objectives otherwise unattainable in single-player mode, and to have much more fun while doing it. You don't *have to*, but we seriously recommend you do join teams in life, however permanently. Even lone wolves benefit from the occasional teamwork, if only to train against other players (friendly PvP), and allow themselves to dream much bigger. Coincidentally, we do have a special place for such independent minds at the Hyperspacing Guild.
